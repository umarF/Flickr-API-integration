# Flickr-API-integration
A simple app that lets you find nearest places to eat and rate them for personal use. Powered by Foursquare API.

# How to use
You need to have cocoapods installed for this to work.

Make sure to do the usual "pod install" before running the project.

Replace the client ID and client secret with your own by making a new app flickr API console. Make the necessary changes in bundle id and redirect urls.
That's it.
